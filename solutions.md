# Solutions

The starting link: [bit.ly/EquusShortSpoopy](https://bit.ly/EquusShortSpoopy) (case sensitive) leads to a dropbox for a zip file.

## Stage 1

### Text file
The text file contained important information about the solution of the stages
> All solutions to stages will be lowercase with no spaces

This could lead someone to the first **red herring**, though most people who found this were because they did not realise bitly links are case sensitive: [bit.ly/equusshortspoopy](https://bit.ly/equusshortspoopy). This leads to a video that references Dead Poets Society.

### GIF file
This is where the puzzle begins. By opening a GIF in a photo editor, each frame of the GIF can be seen. There are 99 frames, each containing either some creature with a number, or just a black frame. Whilst reverse searching some of the monsters is not possible, eventually, with enough persistance, it is possible to deduce that the monsters are all from a horror YouTube series called '[CryptTV](https://www.youtube.com/crypttv)'.
Using [a CryptTV wiki](https://crypttv.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Monsters), the monsters in the series are:
* The Birch
* The Look-See
* Aponi
* Mira
* The Brute
* Soot
* Shelley
* The Thing

Example of a frame:
![Figure1](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/495529780251459584/648433501024026629/unknown.png)

Now, use the numbers to get a letter from the name of the monster that appears in the frame. For example, in the image above, the monster is 'The Birch'. The 4 next to it means the 4th letter. So the result of this frame is 'b'.

Going through the frames and identifying the monsters, then using the numbers to index the letters, results in:
> btyterrorhelp 

This is where one of the few **red herrings** were. By guessing [bit.ly/terrorhelp](https://bit.ly/terrorhelp), this led to a great video of Don't stop me now, but mimed. This is unrelated to the puzzle, but was entertaining.

Now looking at the order and content of the frames themselves, they are all either one frame of black, two frames of black, one frame of monsters or two frames of monsters. Despite the fact that there are more than two options, this is morse code.
The black frames are separators, with one single black frame separating each dot/dash, and the double black frames separating individual letters. A single frame of monsters means dot, and the double frame means dash.
Putting this together, the result is: 
> ilexampoopies

Another 2 **red herrings** are assuming that the link contains actual words, and both [bit.ly/terrorhelpexampoopies](https://bit.ly/terrorhelpexampoopies) and [bit.ly/exampoopiesterrorhelp](https://bit.ly/exampoopiesterrorhelp) lead to random links (though the former acts as a clue to what will come next).

Putting the two strings together:  
btyterrorhelp  
ilexampoopies

then reading top to bottom, left to right, results in the following link for stage 2:

## Stage 2

The link from stage 1 leads to another dropbox with another zip file.

### GIF file
In this GIF, there are only 10 frames. Each frame contained a screenshot of a frame from the famous animated web-series [Salad Fingers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWBFKL6H7rI&list=PL9383CC2C6DBD902F).

Hidden in each frame are numbers, though they are still somewhat visible, it is intended that with some image manipulation (changing brightness / contrast), they would be easier to see.

Before changing brightness/contrast:

After:
![after image manipulation](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/495529780251459584/648446858171252746/unknown.png)

This time, the numbers don't act as an index into any names, rather, they represent seconds. By matching the screenshot to the video in which the screenshot appears, there is one word *spoken* in that second. 

**ERROR**  
There is one error in this stage of the puzzle.
In the following frame:
![error frame](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/495529780251459584/648448954706690048/unknown.png)
The number that appears is 170. The correct number should be 175.

The following contains where each word comes from:
* Word 1: spoons (ep 1, 1:02)
* Word 2: heads (ep 9, 4:43)
* Word 3: really (ep4, 1:40)
* Word 4: fatigued (ep3, 2:37)
* Word 5: flesh (ep 10, 6:42)
* Word 6: sand (ep 7, 2:07)
* Word 7: why (ep 5, 2:01)
* Word 8: improved (ep 11, 2:55)
* Word 9: crikey (ep 6, 2:10)
* Word 10: hair (ep 8, 2:40)

putting this together, the result is:  
> spoonsheadsreallyfatiguedfleshsandwhyimprovedcrikeyhair

## The end
Inside was just a text file, containing the following:  
>Congrats! You've finished Equus' Short Spoopies puzzle.
Just so I know you've finished, DM me a picture of a cute animal.

And that's it!
